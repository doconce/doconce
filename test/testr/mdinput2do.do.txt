======= Test of Markdown input syntax in DocOnce =======

DocOnce can recognize basic Markdown as input in the `.do.txt` file
and transform such text to native DocOnce.

# DocOnce comments also start with #, and can be confused with
# Markdown headings. The confusion is avoided by not having blanks
# after the # character in single-line comments. Multi-line
# comments work well and are never confused with Markdown headings.

# Markdown applies standard HTML
# comments

[hpl: This is a special comment on text that
is rendered by extended Markdown versions. ]

[comment:  This is another version of the special comment on text;
this one without any author name and colon in the beginning.

===== Test of inline formatting =====

Markdown has _boldface_ and *emphasize* typesetting, as well
as `inline verbatim computer code`.

__Paragraph headings.__ These are written using standard Markdown
boldface syntax.

=== Subsubsection heading ===

The Markdown headings can only be of three types: section, subsection,
and subsubsection.

======= Typesetting of computer code =======

Here is a plain code snippet without language specification:

!bc
file=$1
if [ -f $file ]; then
  cp $file $file.cop
fi
# This is Bash - what happens to this comment?
!ec


The same snippet typeset explicitly as Bash, but with a common
indentation to be removed:

!bc shcod
file=$1
if [ -f $file ]; then
  cp $file $file.cop
fi
# This is Bash - what happens to this comment?
!ec


And here is Python:

!bc pycod
from math import sin

def f(x):
    return x*sin(x)

x = 1.4
print(f(x))
!ec


And HTML:

!bc htmlcod
<h1>Some heading</h1>
# And a comment
!ec



======= Test of quoted sections =======

!bblock
Markdown also features quoted
paragraphs that start with a greater
than sign, either just in the beginning
or at every line.
!eblock

If a quoted paragraph with blank lines is desired, you
must use `>` on the beginning of every line.

!bblock
_NOTE_:

This quoted paragragraph is a simulation of a primitive
admon in Markdown.
!eblock

======= Test of lists =======

Markdown applies the dash in itemized lists:

 * This is item 1
 * This is item 2
 * This is item 3

Let us test this in a quoted environment too:

!bblock
_List_:
  * This is item 1
  * This is item 2, which cannot be split between lines
  * This is item 3
!eblock

Enumerated lists go as follows.

 o Item 1
 o Item 2
 o Item 3

======= Test of tables =======

_Markdown Extra_ has a special syntax for tables:


|-----------------------------|
| Item      |    Value | Qty  |
|---l-------r-------c---|
| Computer  | 1600 USD |  5   |
| Phone     |   12 USD |  12  |
| Pipe      |    1 USD | 234  |
|-----------------------------|
#Horizontal marker/rule

-------------------------

======= Test of mathematics =======

You can render *LaTeX* mathematical expressions using _MathJax_, as on "math.stackexchange.com": "https://math.stackexchange.com/":

The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall
n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

!bt
\[ \Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,. \]
!et
