======= First Section =======


Here is some
text for section 1.

This is a *first* example of using the _DocWriter
module_ for writing documents from *Python* scripts.
It could be a nice tool since we do not need to bother
with special typesetting, such as `fixed width fonts`
in plain text.

===== First Subsection =====

Some text for the subsection.

__Test of a Paragraph.__ 
Some paragraph text taken from "Documenting Python": The Python language
has a substantial body of documentation, much of it contributed by various
authors. The markup used for the Python documentation is based on
LaTeX and requires a significant set of macros written specifically
for documenting Python. This document describes the macros introduced
to support Python documentation and how they should be used to support
a wide range of output formats.

This document describes the document classes and special markup used
in the Python documentation. Authors may use this guide, in
conjunction with the template files provided with the distribution, to
create or maintain whole documents or sections.

If you're interested in contributing to Python's documentation,
there's no need to learn LaTeX if you're not so inclined; plain text
contributions are more than welcome as well.
Here is an enumerate list:
o item1
o item2

    o subitem1
    o subitem2

o item3

    o subitem3
    o subitem4
...with some trailing text.
=== First Subsubsection with an Itemize List ===


* item1
* item2

    * subitem1
    * subitem2

* item3

    * subitem3
    * subitem4
Here is some Python code:
!bc

class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

b = B()
b.item = 0  # create a new attribute

!ec

======= Second Section =======

Here is a description list:
- keyword1:  item1
- keyword2:  item2 goes here, with a colon : and some text after

    - key3:  subitem1
    - key4:  subitem2

- key5:  item3

    - key6:  subitem3
    - key7:  subitem4


And here is a table:

   |---------------------------------------|
   | a                 | b                 |
   | c                 | d                 |
   | e                 | and a longer text |
   |---------------------------------------|
