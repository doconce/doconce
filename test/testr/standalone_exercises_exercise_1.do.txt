Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with `Example:`
and then, with the command-line option `--examples_as_exercises` be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


__a)__
State some problem.

__Solution.__
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

__b)__
State some other problem.

__Hint 1.__
A hint can be given.

__Hint 2.__
Maybe even another hint?

__Solution.__
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.
